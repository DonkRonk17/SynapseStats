**For DALL-E 3 Image Generation**

These prompts generate consistent branding for SynapseStats following the Beacon HQ Visual System v1.

## PROMPT 1: Title Card (16:9 Landscape)

```
Create a title card image with a 16:9 aspect ratio in a professional tech style with a dark background (#0a0e27 navy).

The main visual should feature analytical charts, graphs, and data visualizations representing communication patterns. Show glowing bar charts, line graphs trending upward, pie charts with segments, and network connection visualizations. Include visual elements like data points, trend lines, communication flow arrows, and analytical dashboards.

Include the text "SynapseStats" in a modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Inter) in bright cyan (#00d4ff), positioned in the lower third. Add the tagline "Communication Analytics for Team Brain" in smaller white text below it.

Use a color palette of navy blue (#0a0e27), bright cyan (#00d4ff), white (#ffffff), and accent colors for data visualization (purple #a855f7, blue #60a5fa, green #4ade80, orange #ff8c42). Add subtle tech elements like data grids, chart axes, percentage indicators, and metric displays.

The overall mood should be analytical, insightful, and data-driven - conveying powerful communication analysis and metrics.
```

## PROMPT 2: Logo Mark (1:1 Square)

```
Create a square logo icon for a communication analytics system called SynapseStats.

The design should feature a stylized bar chart or analytics symbol with an upward trend. Use a dark navy circle (#0a0e27) as the background. In the center, show a minimalist representation of 3-4 vertical bars of different heights forming an upward trend, or a line graph showing growth.

Use bright cyan (#00d4ff) for the main chart elements, with small accent colors on data points or bars (purple, blue, green). Add a subtle glow effect around the chart and maybe small sparkles or data points floating around it.

The style should be modern, clean, and data-focused - suitable for a professional analytics tool. No text in this version - icon only.
```

## PROMPT 3: Horizontal Logo (3:1 Wide)

```
Create a wide horizontal logo banner (3:1 aspect ratio) for SynapseStats.

On the left third, include a stylized icon of analytics charts - perhaps 3-4 bars of increasing height or a line graph trending upward, with small data points.

In the center and right sections, display "SynapseStats" in a bold, modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Space Grotesk) in bright cyan (#00d4ff).

Use a dark navy background (#0a0e27) with subtle tech elements like data grids, chart patterns, or metric displays flowing through the design. The chart icon should have a slight glow effect in cyan.

Below or integrated with the text, add small data visualization elements (mini bars, trend arrows, percentage symbols) to reinforce the "analytics" concept.

Professional, clean, data-forward style suitable for GitHub headers and documentation.
```

---

## PROMPT 4: App Icon (1:1 Square, Simplified)

```
Create a simple, bold app icon (1:1 square) for SynapseStats that works at small sizes.

Design a minimalist icon featuring a bar chart or trend line. Use a dark navy (#0a0e27) to bright cyan (#00d4ff) gradient as the background. The main symbol should be 3 simple vertical bars of increasing height, or a simple upward trending line with a data point.

Use white for the main chart elements with small accent dots in visualization colors (purple, blue, green) on the bars or data points.

Keep it very simple and bold - it should be recognizable even at 32x32 pixels. Modern, flat design style with subtle depth (maybe a slight shadow or gradient).

No text - icon only. Clean, professional, instantly recognizable as an analytics/stats tool.
```
